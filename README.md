# BEAST2_M2

Beast 2.6.X will not run at full speed with the default beast executable. Switching the bundled file in /bin/ for the one in this repository will provide a large speed increase (3x +) on M2. 
The code is based on the updated code implemented in Beast 2.7.X with ammendmnents made for 2.6.X launcher.
